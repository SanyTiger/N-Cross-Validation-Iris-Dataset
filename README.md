# N-Cross Validation Using the Iris Dataset
This is an implementation of training the dataset using linear regression and classification using decision trees and performing a N-Cross validation on the training data.
In this case, the dataset, [Iris dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/), we assign the value of N to be 10 as we use 3 sets of 3 loops in training the data and 1 for testing. 
Accuracy is 100%.
A working implementation is also on [Kaggle-SanyTiger-IrisDataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sanytiger/n-cross-validation-using-iris-dataset/notebook)
