# N-Cross Validation Using the Iris Dataset
This is an implementation of training the dataset using linear regression and classification using decision trees and performing a N-Cross validation on the training data.
In this case, the dataset, [Iris dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/), we assign the value of N to be 10 as we use 3 sets of 3 loops in training the data and 1 for testing. 
Accuracy is 100%.
A working implementation is also on [Kaggle-SanyTiger-IrisDataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sanytiger/n-cross-validation-using-iris-dataset/notebook)

This implementation is done in R programming language with the dataset Iris from the UCI repository of datasets, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data.

Installing R
------------
Step 1: To find out what is the latest version of R, you can look at the CRAN (Comprehensive R Network) website, http://cran.r-project.org/.
Step 2: Go to http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/cran.r-project.org.
Step 3: Under “Download and Install R”, click on the “Windows”/"Linux" link and under “Subdirectories”, click on the “base” link.
Step 4: The R Setup Wizard will appear in a window. Click “Next” at the bottom of the R Setup wizard window and follow up with the installation.
Step 5: Once installation is complete, check if there is an “R” icon on the desktop of the computer that you are using. If so, double-click on the “R” icon to start R.
Step 6: Download RStudio, an IDE for R from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
Step 7: Select the "Free" version and follow with the installation.

Running R code on RStudio
-------------------------
Make sure you have the dataset loaded/path of dataset assigned into RStudio.
Run each line using the "Run" button or click "CTRL+R" to run.

Working Code On Kaggle
-----------------------
The same working code for implementing N-Cross Validation on the Iris dataset is hosted on Kaggle.com, https://www.kaggle.com/sanytiger/n-cross-validation-using-iris-dataset/notebook. This site allows users to host machine learning and data mining codes and provides functionalities to run graphs and plots on the website. The site also sports hosting of different versions of the code.
